# Charis SIL [![Build Status](http://build.palaso.org/app/rest/builds/buildType:Fonts_Charis/statusIcon)](http://build.palaso.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=Fonts_Charis&guest=1)

The Charis SIL font family supports the broad variety of writing systems that use the Latin and Cyrillic scripts.

This project uses a UFO-based design and production workflow, with all sources in open formats and a completely open-source build toolkit. For more details see [SIL Font Development Notes](https://silnrsi.github.io/silfontdev/en-US/Introduction.html).

_This is an early beta version of the next major release (v6). Please use it only for testing, not production, and give us your feedback._

_This major release includes spacing changes to some glyphs, so text in existing documents may reflow. However, the spacing changes are mostly for rare glyphs that most users are not likely to use. If you see significant differences in layout between version 5.000 and this version of the fonts please let us know._

Known issues in this beta release, which will be addressed in later versions:

- Graphite support is in flux and may not work correctly
- Feature documentation is outdated
- There is no support for TypeTuner
- There are no regional subsets
