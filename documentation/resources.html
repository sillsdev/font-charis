    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>These fonts are supported by all major operating systems (macOS, Windows, Linux-based, iOS, and Android), however the extent of that support depends on the individual OS and application.</p>
    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    <p>Install the fonts by decompressing the .zip archive and installing the fonts using the standard font installation process for .ttf (TrueType/OpenType) fonts for your platform. For additional tips see the help page on <a href="https://software.sil.org/fonts/installation">Font installation</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="keyboarding">Keyboarding</h2>
    <p>These fonts do not include keyboards or other software for entering text. To type the symbols in these fonts use the keyboarding systems provided in your OS or use a separate utility. SIL’s <a href="https://keyman.com/">Keyman</a> provides keyboards for over 2000 languages and works on all major desktop and mobile platforms. For more information see the help page on <a href="http://software.sil.org/fonts/keyboarding">Keyboarding resources</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="rendering-and-application-support">Rendering and application support</h2>
    <p>These fonts will work normally like any other fonts in most applications. If the writing system requires special diacritic positioning the application/OS will need to support OpenType. If special font features need to be activated the application will need to provide a way to turn on the feature or choose the feature setting. Details of current application support, and specific techniques for activating features, are on the <a href="http://software.sil.org/fonts/features">Features</a> help page.</p>
