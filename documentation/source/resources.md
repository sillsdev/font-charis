## Requirements

These fonts are supported by all major operating systems (macOS, Windows, Linux-based, iOS, and Android), however the extent of that support depends on the individual OS and application.

## Installation

Install the fonts by decompressing the .zip archive and installing the fonts using the standard font installation process for .ttf (TrueType/OpenType) fonts for your platform. For additional tips see [Font installation](https://software.sil.org/fonts/installation) on the SIL software website.

## Keyboarding

These fonts do not include keyboards or other software for entering text. To type the symbols in these fonts use the keyboarding systems provided in your OS or use a separate utility. SILâ€™s [Keyman](https://keyman.com/) provides keyboards for over 2000 languages and works on all major desktop and mobile platforms. For more information see [Keyboarding](http://software.sil.org/fonts/keyboarding) on the SIL software website.

## Rendering and application support

These fonts will work normally like any other fonts in most applications. If the writing system requires special diacritic positioning the application/OS will need to support OpenType. If special font features need to be activated the application will need to provide a way to turn on the feature or choose the feature setting. Details of current application support, and specific techniques for activating features, can be found on the [Features](http://software.sil.org/fonts/features) page of the SIL software website.
