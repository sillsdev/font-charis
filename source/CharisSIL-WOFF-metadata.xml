      Charis is similar to Bitstream Charter, one of the first fonts designed
      specifically for laser printers. It is highly readable and holds up well in
      less-than-ideal reproduction environments. It also has a full set of styles
      - regular, italic, bold, bold italic - and so is more useful in general
      publishing than Doulos SIL. Charis is a serif proportionally spaced font
      optimized for readability in long printed documents.
      
      The goal for this product was to provide a single Unicode-based font family
      that would contain a comprehensive inventory of glyphs needed for almost any
      Roman- or Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for phonetic or
      orthographic needs. In addition, there is provision for other characters and
      symbols useful to linguists. This font makes use of state-of-the-art font
      technologies to support complex typographic issues, such as the need to
      position arbitrary combinations of base glyphs and diacritics optimally.
      
      Four fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:
      
      * Charis SIL Regular
      * Charis SIL Bold
      * Charis SIL Italic
      * Charis SIL Bold Italic
      
      The design of the basic character set of Charis SIL is similar (but not
      identical) to Bitstream Charter, designed by Matthew Carter. The following
      notice accompanied the Charter fonts:

      for any purpose and without restriction; provided, that this notice is left
      intact on all copies of such fonts and that Bitstream's trademark is
      acknowledged as shown below on all unmodified copies of the 4 Charter
      Type 1 fonts.

      A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner
      ----------------------------------------------------
      
      The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Charis" and "SIL" in
      the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of Charis
      SIL. However, SIL International (the Copyright Holder) grants through
      this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font Names
      in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as long
      as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used,
      unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and
      "Charis SIL" is not the resulting font family name.
      
      TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
      terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
      prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
      making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
      name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named
      "Charis SIL Literacy SomeFarAwayPlace" but a derivative of that font made
      with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Charis" and "SIL"
      Reserved Font Names and would have to be named something like "Grace Foo".
      
      
      ChangeLog
      ---------
      (This should list both major and minor changes, most recent first.)
      
      17 Mar 2021 (SIL NRSI team) Charis SIL version 5.960 (beta2)
      *This is still a beta version - use with care and not for*
      *any critical or time-sensitive projects!*
      *We have tried to address all reported issues from beta1 in this beta,*
      *however some fixes may still be in process.*
      
      Changes since version 5.950 (beta1):
      
      - Removed DSIGs added in version 5.000. These have now been removed to
      reflect current best practice font development guidance. Adobe InDesign
      will complain that fonts cannot be found if a document last saved with
      version 5.000 is opened with version 5.960 or later installed. It will
      be necessary to find/replace the fonts in the document using the command
      in the Type menu. Please also look over the document carefully to note
      any places where changes in the fonts have affected letterforms or spacing.
      
      - Graphite has been removed. Application and OS support for OpenType has
      greatly improved, so the need for Graphite in this font family is greatly
      reduced. *If this affects you, and you find that OpenType does not provide
      sufficient support for your needs, please contact us right away.*
      
      - Width of typographic spaces have been made more consistent to reflect
      common publishing industry usage. Note that this may affect line and page
      lengths. Affected spaces:
      U+2000 EN QUAD (made width consistent)
      U+2001 EM QUAD (made width consistent)
      U+2007 FIGURE SPACE (made wider to match numerals in all styles)
      U+2009 THIN SPACE (made narrower)
      U+202F NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE (made narrower)
      
      - Fixed some small capital correspondences
      
      - Improved miscellaneous anchor positions, including the position of diacritics
      below glyphs with macrons below (e.g. U+1E0F LATIN SMALL LETTER D WITH LINE BELOW)
      
      - Fixes and improvements to various glyphs:
      U+02E4 MODIFIER LETTER SMALL REVERSED GLOTTAL STOP (form)
      U+1AB3 COMBINING DOWNWARDS ARROW (position fixes since beta 1)
      U+1D15 LATIN LETTER SMALL CAPITAL OU (form)
      U+1D77 LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED G (position)

      U+A77F LATIN SMALL LETTER TURNED INSULAR G (position)
      U+A7F8 MODIFIER LETTER CAPITAL H WITH STROKE (form)

      - Replaced font features documentation with updated version in a new format
      (see documentation/CharisSIL-font-features.html)
      
      - Web fonts are provided in both WOFF and WOFF2 formats
      
      - Remaining known issues in this release
      Tone letters (U+02E5..02E9) and related features are not working properly
      There is no support for TypeTuner
      There are no regional subsets
      
      
      31 Mar 2020 (SIL NRSI team) Charis SIL version 5.950 (beta1)
      *This is an early beta version of the next major release.*
      *Please use it only for testing, not production, and give us your feedback.*
      *This major release includes spacing changes to some glyphs, so text in*
      *existing documents may reflow. However, the spacing changes are mostly*
      *for rare glyphs that most users are not likely to use. If you see*
      *significant differences in layout between version 5.000 and this*
      *version of the fonts please let us know.*

      PREAMBLE
      The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.
      
      The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
